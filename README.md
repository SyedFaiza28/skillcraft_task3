Bank Marketing Prediction Using Decision Tree

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Task Objective

Use a decision tree to classify customer responses (yes/no) to a marketing campaign.
Analyze the impact of various customer attributes (e.g., age, job, marital status) on the prediction.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical data with Label Encoding.
Model Training: Using DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn.
Visualization: Plotting the decision tree structure.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Technologies Used
